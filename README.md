Hi, I’m Lulu
👀 I’m into building full-stack web apps using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AI platforms.
🌱 Currently learning AI frameworks and improving my skills in Go for backend APIs.
💞️ Open to collaborating on web dev, e-commerce, and AI projects.
📫 Reach me at LuluLogicz.com or LinkedIn: L. Abrahams.
⚡ Fun fact: I built an AI-powered e-commerce platform that recommends products based on user behavior!
