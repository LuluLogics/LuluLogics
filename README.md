Hey, call me Lulu
👀 I’m interested in building efficient and innovative web applications, particularly full-stack solutions involving React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AI-driven platforms.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI frameworks and further honing my expertise in backend development, particularly in Go and other high-performance languages for API development.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, e-commerce platforms, AI-driven systems, and any innovative tech solutions. I love working with dynamic teams and enjoy contributing to open-source projects.
